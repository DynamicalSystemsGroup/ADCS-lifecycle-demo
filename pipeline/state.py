"""Typed per-stage pipeline state.

WP1 splits `pipeline.runner.run_pipeline` into stage-level free
functions threaded by a `PipelineState` object. Each stage's result
record is a frozen dataclass attached to the state so downstream
stages — and interrogation tools like `interrogate.rerun` — can read
prior-stage outputs without inspecting locals or re-querying the
graph.

The `activity_to_stage` table maps `p-plan` step IRI fragments
(emitted by `traceability.plan_execution.emit_stage_activity`) to
their pipeline stage numbers. Kept in sync with
`traceability.plan_execution.STEP_NAMES`; covered by a unit test.
