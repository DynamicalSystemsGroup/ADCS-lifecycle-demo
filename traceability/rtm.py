"""Requirements Traceability Matrix assembly and validation.

The RTM is held in an rdflib Dataset with named graphs sized to match
Flexo MMS conventions (see pipeline/dataset.py and the named-graph IRIs
exported by ontology/prefixes). Existing SPARQL queries continue to
work unmodified because the Dataset is built with default_union=True.

Layer assignments:
- <rtm:ontology>      ontology/*.ttl (TBox + shapes + individuals)
- <adcs:structural>   structural/*.ttl (SysMLv2 instance data)
- <adcs:evidence>     evidence artifacts (populated by stage 4)
- <adcs:attestations> attestation events (populated by stage 6)
